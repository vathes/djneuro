Vathes is excited to welcome Austin Hilberg and Shan Shen to the team. 
Austin Hilberg has a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from UCLA, where he studied the human visual system and visual attention control using fMRI and EEG. Since graduating, he has been working in Silicon Valley developing medical ultrasound systems. In his spare time, he enjoys creating virtual reality experiences and tinkering with electronic devices. Austin is very excited to apply his engineering, programming, and neuroscience background to his role as a Data Scientist at Vathes.

Shan Shen has a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Baylor College of Medicine. During her graduate training, she studied feedback circuits in mouse visual cortex with a wide range of techniques including optogenetics, imaging and electrophysiology. She also has experience working on human visual psychophysics, using Bayesian modeling. Throughout her academic career, she has been using DataJoint to organize data and facilitate analysis. With a combination of experience in experiments, modeling, and data analysis, Shan is very excited to work as a Data Scientist at Vathes and is looking forward to helping neuroscientists build efficient pipelines for data analysis.
