DataJoint NEURO's data scientist Shan Shen visited multiple labs that show interest to DataJoint, including Tony Movshon Lab at New York University, the NYU U19 team, Dmitriy Aronov Lab at Columbia University, and Tatiana Engel lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. During this visit, Shan collected valuable feedback from people who showed interest in DataJoint or have already adopted DataJoint independently. DataJoint NEURO team is looking forward to keeping close contact with the DataJoint community.
