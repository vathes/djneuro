DataJoint Neuro has renewed the agreement to support the development of experiment data pipelines for the [Mesoscale Activity Project](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/funded-project/multi-regional-neuronal-dynamics-of-memory-guided-flexible-behavior/). The open-source code for this pipeline, including electrophysiology, behavior, histology, and video tracking data is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/mesoscale-activity-map/map-ephys](https://github.com/mesoscale-activity-map/map-ephys).

Currently, the team is implementing an automatic report generation process and adding mechanisms to improve cross-lab data sharing for machine learning and modeling efforts. Later in the year, efforts will expand into adding web-based visualization and navigation to allow more casual access to the data to the wider Neuroscience community.
